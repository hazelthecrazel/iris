Basic Information
</div>
<div id="basicbox">
<b>Name:</b> Iris<br>
<b>Age:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Species:</b> Faerie<br>
<b>Race:</b> Eastern Sidhe<br>
<b>Origin:</b> Gorias<br>
<b>Height:</b> 5'7"<br>
<b>Weight:</b> 128lbs
</div>
<div id="content">
<b>Physical Appearance<br></b>
As are most of the Gorian Fae Iris is indisputably beautiful in her own right. Her skin is porcelain fair with spots of golden freckles adorning her cheeks and it frames her shapely features quite well. She has the idea woman’s body shape: Narrow shoulders, thin waist, wide hips, and long legs that move with a grace that could rival a dancer’s. Iris has an average bust and a smooth rounded bottom, both full with understated muscle as with the rest of her body. Her hair is a fiery red, falling down her shoulders and framing her face in coils of living flames and her eyes are like Emerald embers, the whites of them tinted green while her actual iris is a ring of vibrant lime green. Her hair frames her gorgeous features with ease. Iris has rounded high cheekbones and a strong jaw, full red lips enticing with their slight natural pout. She keeps her eyebrows trimmed neatly into an arch and her signature Fae ears stick up from the side of her head rather than out. Iris’ wing manifestation is that of a Bird of Paradise, the tribal tattoo spreading across her back in wispy tendril-like feathers.<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Iris is arguably one of the best players of Devil’s Advocate that Faerie Realms can produce, with a magic borne entirely on the basis of seeking information. Manipulation and deceit are her forte and Gorias is the perfect battlefield for her. Both tactful and cunning, The Eye uses all the tools in her kit to gain the upper hand in social and political situations. Iris is known for blackmailing corrupt Faerie government officials, threatening to expose their corruption to the masses if she isn’t given what she requests. The petty squabbles of her people are viewed with a monstrous gleam in her eye, for those who hold the information hold the power and she holds any information she wishes to have. Iris is incredibly quick at feigning respect towards those who outmatch her, coming across as loyal and useful while hiding the underlying fact that she is a conniving and backstabbing woman in a facade of words and expressions.
<br>She has one redeeming factor though: Her hatred. What drove her to join the Rowan Troop is Iris’ hatred for the Xinks and what they made her do to other Faeries, and her anger is transformed into a resolve that will allow her to ‘play nice’ and abandon her petty Gorian ways to make their group work.. At least in front of her comrades.

History

<div id="tab3">
  <b>Mana Sensitivity</b><br>
  The Fae-kind are very sensitive to auras and mana, allowing them to feel or see when another being is drawing from their mana pool or activating their mana, even if something is blocking their vision (assuming the blockage is Mage rank and under), a faint outline of an aura can be seen--or sensed--so long as the fellow magic user is within a twenty foot radius of the Fae (and they are actively being focused on). They cannot tell how much mana is being used or the user has left over, they are merely sensitive to when it is currently in use within the radius.<br><br>
  <b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
  The body of the Fae-kind is light, petite, and athletic. They can move double the speed of the average human and the strongest Fae's speeds can rival that of a hummingbird's.<br><br>
  <b>Enhanced Flexibility</b><br>
  Their bodies are as flexible as they are light, allowing them to contort their shapes into absurd formations. Something someone would expect to see in a circus act.<br><br>
  <b>Burning Calories</b><br>
  The Fae-kind eat thousands upon thousands of calories on purpose and burn them off very quickly. Physical sugary foods is said to help their mental and magic stability, often allowing them slightly faster mana regeneration than what is average if consumed when their mana-pool is either completely drained or close to it.<br><br>
  <b>Hidden Wings</b><br>
  Tribal-like wing markings cover the backs of the Sidhe-kind. These tribal markings cause winged silhouettes to form as an aura behind each individual Faerie when they dip into their mana pool, the kind of wings that manifest can differ from person to person, but the most common is the shape of a butterfly.

<i>"A tree of magic that amplifies the power of one’s mind. Psionic mages can achieve sensory feats such as telekinetics, mental communication, as well as high level detection and hyperawareness spells that allow them to gain extra information about people and the environment around them. Highly skilled users of the Psionic tree can achieve (EXTREMELY LIMITED) future vision, small scale possession and bodily control of others. Upon reaching expert mage, Psionic mages achieve the ability to spirit walk, a technique that allows them to astral project their consciousness and leave their bodies behind. Spirit walking mages can pass through most physical objects (unless infused with magic etc.) and remain undetected (unless spotted by certain sensory spells) as they roam. The physical body stays in one place as this happens, but once the spirit walker wishes to reconnect with their form, the body will transport to wherever the consciousness may be. "</i>

<i>"While a false magician may play with smoke and mirrors to dazzle mortals, mages have a much more precise sense of awareness. Therefore, Deception mages take the next step and make their illusions reality. Deception mages use any manner of tricks and illusions to confuse, dazzle, or even torture their opponents. These tricksters rely solely on humble illusions at lower ranks, but may develop into such things as creating clones of themselves, or even mind control to a small extent."</i>

<i>"A simple trick of the light, or perhaps a distortion in what you believe really happened. Most mental manipulation magics specify in the act of creating illusions or inserting oneself into the mind of others, but Paramnesia is much different. Instead it preys on the mind and senses at the same time, creating a fabrication that could seem so very real that you simply believe it is so. However it specifies more in the strength of mind, pursuing memories and thoughts, conveying them across the wielder’s own mind in a way that makes them omniscient in a room of strangers. It may alter senses and emotions, shifting across the brain in an elegant dance that can force someone to do or say things that would not happen given a normal circumstance by making them believe that it is what they want to do. A weapon in the wrong hands and a powerful utility in the right."</i>
